    <h1>Definitions</h1>

    <h2>1. Geologic Principles</h2>
    <h3>Principle of Superposition</h3>
    <p>In any sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rock layers, the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. This principle helps geologists understand the chronological order of rock formations.</p>
    <h3>Principle of Original Horizontality</h3>
    <p>Sedimentary layers are generally deposited in a horizontal or nearly horizontal position due to gravity. If the layers are tilted or folded, it suggests they have been moved from their original position by geological forces.</p>
    <h3>Principle of Original Continuity</h3>
    <p>Layers of sediment extend laterally in all directions until they thin out or encounter a barrier. If a layer stops abruptly, it might have been eroded or disrupted after deposition.</p>
    <h3>Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships</h3>
    <p>If a geological feature, such as a fault or an igneous intrusion, cuts through another rock layer, it must be younger than the layers it cuts. This helps geologists identify the relative ages of formations.</p>
    <h3>Principle of Inclusions</h3>
    <p>Fragments of rock (inclusions) found within another rock layer must be older than the rock layer containing them. This is because the inclusion had to exist before being incorporated into the surrounding material.</p>

    <h3>Principle of succession</h3>
    <p>particular fossils species only found in limited strata</p>

    <h2>2. Unconformities</h2>
    <h3>Unconformity</h3>
    <img src="https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444528186/htm/reschar_chapter_04/figure_4_5.jpg" alt="Resource Characterization Image" width="500">
    <p>An unconformity is a surface that represents a period where no sediment was deposited or erosion removed layers, indicating a gap in the geologic record.</p>
    <h3>Angular Unconformity</h3>
    <p>Occurs when tilted or folded rock layers are overlain by younger, more horizontally layered rocks, indicating a past period of deformation and erosion before newer layers were deposited.</p>
    <h3>Nonconformity</h3>
    <p>This type of unconformity occurs when sedimentary rock layers lie on top of eroded igneous or metamorphic rock, showing that an older, crystalline rock was exposed and eroded before new sediment was deposited.</p>
    <h3>Disconformity</h3>
    <p>Found between parallel sedimentary rock layers, a disconformity signifies a time of non-deposition or erosion that disrupted continuous sedimentary accumulation.</p>

    <h2>3. Fossils and Dating</h2>
    <h3>Fossil Succession</h3>
    <p>Fossils appear in a specific, recognizable order in the rock layers, allowing geologists to use fossils to date the relative ages of rocks based on this predictable pattern.</p>
    <h3>Index Fossil</h3>
    <p>An index fossil is from a species that was widespread, short-lived, and easily identifiable, making it ideal for dating the specific rock layer in which it’s found.
        <br>occupy short span of time and have large geographic range and are very useful for correlating strata
        <br>AMMONITES ARE IMPORTANT
    </p>
    <h3>Fossil Assemblage</h3>
    <p>A collection of fossils found together in a rock layer that helps establish the relative age.</p>
    <h3>Mass Number</h3>
    <p>The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom’s nucleus, giving insight into the isotope’s stability and weight top left.</p>
    <h3>Atomic Number</h3>
    <p>The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus, which determines the element’s identity and properties, bottom left.</p>
    <h3>Atomic Weight</h3>
    <p>The weighted average mass of an element’s naturally occurring isotopes, often expressed as the mass number.</p>
    <h3>Isotope(s)</h3>
    <p>Atoms of an element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, giving them different atomic masses.</p>
    <h3>Beta Decay: n -> p^+ + e^- (z+1)</h3>
    <p>A radioactive decay process where a neutron turns into a proton, emitting a beta particle, which changes the atom into a different element.
    </p>
    <h3>Electron Capture</h3>
    <p> p^+ + e^- -> n (z-1)
        In this decay process, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, turning a proton into a neutron, often resulting in the formation of a new element.</p>
    <h3>Alpha Decay</h3>
    <p> Large unstable nucleus -> smaller more stable nucleus + alpha particle (A-4, Z-2)
        <br>A radioactive decay process where an atom emits an alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons), resulting in a new, lighter element.</p>
    <h3>Half-Life</h3>
    <p>The time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive substance to decay, helping determine the age of rocks and fossils.</p>
    <h3>Closure Temperature</h3>
    <p>The temperature below which a mineral in a rock becomes closed to the exchange of isotopes, effectively "locking in" the isotopic composition for dating purposes.</p>

    <h3>Radioactive dating Assumptions</h3>
    <p> T(1/2) is constant
        <br>closed system since t=0, no gain/loss of p/d, only date fresh samples, fresh igneous/metamorphic rocks work best
        <br>initial D not always 0

        , occur when large masses of earth or rock move along relatively flat or gently inclined planes of weakness, such as bedding planes, joints, or fault lines.
        <br>These planes of weakness can form due to various geological processes, including weathering or tectonic activity. 
        <br>Gravity is the main driving force, but factors like water infiltration, earthquakes, and human activity can reduce friction along these planes, making the slope unstable and triggering the slide.
