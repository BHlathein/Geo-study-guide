      <h2>Geologic Time: Relative Dating</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relative vs. Absolute Dating:</strong> Relative dating places events in a sequential order without knowing the exact age, using methods such as comparing rock layers. Absolute dating, on the other hand, provides a specific age using radiometric techniques, measuring decay of isotopes to determine when events occurred.</li>
        <li><strong>Principles of Relative Dating by Steno:</strong> Fundamental principles used to understand rock formation and relationships:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Superposition:</strong> In undisturbed layers, the oldest layer lies at the bottom, and each successive layer above is younger.</li>
            <li><strong>Original Horizontality:</strong> Layers of sediments are originally deposited horizontally; tilting or folding indicates later geological events.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Cutting Relationships:</strong> Geological features like faults or intrusions are younger than the rock layers they cut through.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Unconformities:</strong> Surfaces indicating gaps in the geologic record, often due to erosion or non-deposition.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Disconformity:</strong> Represents a period of erosion or non-deposition between parallel sedimentary layers.</li>
            <li><strong>Nonconformity:</strong> Occurs between older igneous/metamorphic rocks and younger sedimentary layers on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Angular Unconformity:</strong> Tilted or folded sedimentary rocks overlain by younger, flat-lying layers, indicating past tectonic activity.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Determining Relative Ages:</strong> Geologists use principles like cross-cutting relationships and superposition to sequence rock layers, establishing the order in which events occurred.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying Unconformities:</strong> Unconformities are identified by observing changes in rock continuity, such as gaps or erosional surfaces in diagrams or rock samples.</li>
        <li><strong>Fossils and Relative Dating:</strong> Fossils provide clues for relative dating by correlating rock layers with known fossil assemblages.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Index fossils:</strong> Distinctive, widespread fossils limited to a particular time range, which helps in dating the rocks in which they’re found.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Geologic Time: Absolute Dating</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscripts and Superscripts:</strong> In isotope notation, superscripts indicate the atomic mass (total protons + neutrons), while subscripts represent the atomic number (number of protons).</li>
        <li><strong>Atomic Number, Mass Number, Atomic Weight, and Isotopes:</strong> Key terms to understand atomic structure:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> Number of protons in the nucleus, determining the element.</li>
            <li><strong>Mass Number:</strong> Total number of protons and neutrons, indicating an isotope's mass.</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Weight:</strong> Weighted average of an element’s isotopes based on natural abundance.</li>
            <li><strong>Isotopes:</strong> Variants of the same element with different numbers of neutrons; radioactive isotopes decay over time, useful for dating.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Radioactive Decay:</strong> Process where unstable isotopes lose energy by emitting particles; critical in radiometric dating for age determination.</li>
        <li><strong>Types of Radioactive Decay:</strong> Different decay mechanisms release particles or energy:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha Decay:</strong> Emits two protons and two neutrons, reducing atomic number by 2 and mass by 4 (e.g., Uranium-238 to Thorium-234).</li>
            <li><strong>Beta Decay:</strong> Neutron converts to a proton, increasing atomic number by 1 with no mass change (e.g., Carbon-14 to Nitrogen-14).</li>
            <li><strong>Gamma Decay:</strong> Release of high-energy photons without changing atomic structure.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Half-Life:</strong> The time it takes for half of a sample of radioactive isotope to decay, a critical concept in calculating the ages of rocks and fossils.</li>
        <li><strong>Dating Methods:</strong> Common radiometric dating methods include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Uranium-Lead Dating:</strong> Effective for dating ancient igneous rocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Potassium-Argon Dating:</strong> Useful for dating volcanic rocks older than 100,000 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon-14 Dating:</strong> Best for dating organic materials up to about 50,000 years old.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>C-14 vs. Other Methods:</strong> Carbon-14 is specific to recent, organic materials, unlike other methods suited to much older, inorganic rocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Assumptions in Radiometric Dating:</strong> Relies on constant decay rates, closed systems, and an accurate measure of initial daughter elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Dating Events:</strong> Radiometric dating records events like rock crystallization or metamorphic reformation, not the time the rocks were originally formed.</li>
        <li><strong>Closed System Viability:</strong> Preservation of a closed system is key for accurate dating; factors like weathering or metamorphism can alter isotopic ratios.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Weathering and Soil</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chemical vs. Physical Weathering:</strong> Physical weathering breaks rocks into smaller pieces without altering their composition, while chemical weathering changes mineral composition.</li>
        <li><strong>Types of Weathering:</strong> Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Weathering:</strong> Frost wedging (water freezing in cracks), unloading (reduction in pressure on rocks), and thermal expansion (temperature changes).</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Weathering:</strong> Oxidation (reaction with oxygen), hydrolysis (reaction with water), and dissolution (soluble minerals dissolve in water).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Unloading/Exfoliation Joints:</strong> Form when overlying pressure decreases, allowing rock to expand and crack, typically in granite.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling Joints:</strong> Form in cooling igneous rocks as they contract, often creating hexagonal columns in rocks like basalt.</li>
        <li><strong>Assisting Mechanisms:</strong> Physical weathering increases surface area, accelerating chemical reactions; chemical weathering weakens rock structure, aiding physical breakdown.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil Profile Formation:</strong> Soil develops distinct layers called horizons:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>O Horizon:</strong> Organic material layer at the surface.</li>
            <li><strong>A Horizon:</strong> Topsoil, rich in organic and mineral material.</li>
            <li><strong>E Horizon:</strong> lighter colored, significantly leached.</li>
            <li><strong>B Horizon:</strong> Subsoil, accumulation zone for minerals leached from above.</li>
            <li><strong>C Horizon:</strong> Predominately bedrock.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Soil Types:</strong> Different soils form in varying climates:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Alfisol:</strong> Temperate climate, medium thickness, organic rich A-horizon, humus+leached soil, iron oxide accumulate calcite is leached.</li>
            <li><strong>Aridisol:</strong> Develops in dry climates, thin, build up of soluble material like calcite significant leaching, well developed on limestone.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxisol:</strong> Forms in tropical areas, iron-rich, no B horizon nothing leached accumulates, buildup of insoluble materials.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>Mass Wasting</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Mass wasting is the movement of soil, rock, and debris downslope due to gravity. It includes landslides, mudflows, and slumps.</li>
          <li><strong>Types of Mass Wasting:</strong> Classified by movement type and material:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Falls:</strong> Occur when rock breaks loose and falls freely or bounces down a slope.</li>
              <li><strong>Slides:</strong> Movement of material along a well-defined surface, such as a rockslide on a cliff face.</li>
              <li><strong>Flows:</strong> Material behaves more like a fluid; debris flows, mudflows, and earthflows are common examples.</li>
              <li><strong>Slumps:</strong> Occur when a block of material moves along a curved surface, leaving a scarp at the top.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Factors Influencing Mass Wasting:</strong> Key elements include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Water Content:</strong> Saturation of soil and rock can weaken materials and promote sliding.</li>
              <li><strong>Slope Angle:</strong> Steeper slopes are more prone to mass wasting due to gravity's effect.</li>
              <li><strong>Vegetation:</strong> Roots stabilize slopes; removal can increase mass wasting risk.</li>
              <li><strong>Human Activity:</strong> Construction, mining, and deforestation can destabilize slopes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Preventative Measures:</strong> Techniques to reduce mass wasting risks include retaining walls, slope grading, drainage control, and afforestation.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Meandering Streams:</strong> Develop sinuous curves, or meanders, and typically form in flat areas.</li>
              <li><strong>Braided Streams:</strong> Characterized by multiple channels that split and rejoin, often carrying high sediment loads.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Drainage Patterns:</strong> The pattern a stream system follows, influenced by underlying geology, includes dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis patterns.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
  
      <section>
        <h2>Flooding</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Floods:</strong> Occur when water levels rise and overflow riverbanks, often due to heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, or storm surges.</li>
          <li><strong>Types of Floods:</strong> Different types are influenced by factors like location and cause:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Flash Floods:</strong> Rapid, short-duration floods resulting from intense rainfall over a small area.</li>
              <li><strong>River Floods:</strong> Caused by prolonged rainfall over large areas, leading to rivers overflowing.</li>
              <li><strong>Coastal Floods:</strong> Occur due to storm surges, high tides, or tsunamis along coastlines.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Flood Recurrence Interval:</strong> The average time between floods of a particular size; a 100-year flood has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year.</li>

        </ul>
      </section>
  
      <section>
        <h2>Groundwater</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Groundwater Storage and Movement:</strong> Water infiltrates the ground and fills porous spaces in soil and rock, moving through aquifers.</li>
          <li><strong>Aquifers:</strong> Permeable rock layers that store and transmit groundwater. Two main types:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Unconfined Aquifer:</strong> Open to the surface, recharged directly by precipitation.</li>
              <li><strong>Confined Aquifer:</strong> Bounded by impermeable layers, under pressure, often recharged far from where it’s accessed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Water Table:</strong> The boundary between saturated and unsaturated zones; it fluctuates with precipitation and groundwater extraction.</li>
          <li><strong>Porosity and Permeability:</strong> Porosity is the volume of pore space in rock or sediment, while permeability is the ability to transmit water. High porosity doesn’t always mean high permeability.</li>
          <li><strong>Wells and Artesian Systems:</strong> Wells tap into groundwater; artesian wells flow naturally due to pressure in a confined aquifer.</li>
          <li><strong>Groundwater Contamination:</strong> Pollutants from sources like agriculture, industry, or landfills can degrade water quality in aquifers.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wave Action:</strong> Waves erode, transport, and deposit sediment along coastlines, shaping shorelines over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Coastal Erosion:</strong> Waves and currents erode beaches and cliffs; factors include wave energy, rock type, and coastal slope.</li>
          <li><strong>Longshore Drift:</strong> Process by which sediment moves along the shore, driven by wave action at an angle to the coastline.</li>
          <li><strong>Tides:</strong> Periodic rise and fall of sea levels caused by gravitational interactions between the Earth, moon, and sun.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Spring Tides:</strong> Occur during full and new moons, with higher high tides and lower low tides.</li>
              <li><strong>Neap Tides:</strong> Occur during quarter moons, with less extreme high and low tides.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Shoreline Features:</strong> Created by coastal processes:
            <ul>

              <li><strong>Spits:</strong> Narrow extensions of sand that project from the shore into the water.</li>
              <li><strong>Sea Arches and Sea Stacks:</strong> Erosion of headlands forms arches; when arches collapse, isolated stacks remain.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Human Impact on Coastal Processes:</strong> Development, seawalls, and groins affect natural coastal erosion and sediment transport.</li>
          <li><strong>Coastal Management:</strong> Includes beach nourishment, artificial reefs, and shoreline armoring to mitigate erosion and protect infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
